## Commit message convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages to automate the release process with [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version). Please make sure to follow the commit message convention when you make a commit.

Note that all pull request should be merged as **squash and merge** for standard-version.

## Releasing

We make a release with [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version). It automatically creates changelog, tag a new release and commit it. The command `npm run release` does these jobs.
